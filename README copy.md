# Tabless Thursday

People often have a million tabs up and lose track of what they were doing. This website lets you organize them in to-do lists and make a note of why it was important. Makes it easy to pick up where you left off. 

MVP: User can login and copy their links from open tabs into categories/lists. 

Stretch: A second user can login and see friends' saved tabs. 

Super Stretch: "Tab Genius" feature. Allows you to turn websites into autoupdate widgets, loads up a specific section of a website similar to Apple's Web Clips feature in Safari.
